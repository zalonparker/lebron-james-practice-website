            <h2>Who is Lebron James?</h2>
            <p>James was born on December 30, 1984, in Akron, Ohio. At an early age, James showed a natural talent for
                basketball. He was recruited by St. Vincent-St. Mary High School to join their basketball team in 1999.
                Overall, James scored 2,657 points, 892 rebounds and 523 assists during his four years there.

                As a freshman, James averaged 18 points per game. He helped the team to a Division III state title by
                scoring 25 points in the championship game. Word of his advanced basketball skills spread, and James
                received several honors for his performance.

                As a high school sophomore, James was chosen for the USA Today All-USA First Team. He was the first
                sophomore ever selected for this award. His team also won the Division III state title for the second
                year in a row.

                The following school year, James was named PARADE magazine's High School Boys Basketball Player of the
                Year and Gatorade Player of the Year. Following the end of his junior year, James was such a strong
                player that he contemplated going pro.

                Deciding to finish his education, James had a tremendous senior year on the court. He averaged 31.6
                points per game, helping his team clinch their third state title. The St. Vincent-St. Mary High School
                team also earned the top national ranking that year. James would soon emerge as one of the National
                Basketball Association's leading players.</p>

            <h2>NBA Draft</h2>
            <img class="image" src="img/lebron draft picture.jpeg" alt="lebron nba draft picture">
            <p>James was selected by his hometown team, the Cleveland Cavaliers, as the first overall pick of the 2003
                NBA draft.[42] In his first regular season game, he scored 25 points in a 106–92 loss to the Sacramento
                Kings, setting an NBA record for the most points scored by a prep-to-pro player in his debut
                performance.[43] At the conclusion of the 2003–2004 season, he became the first Cavalier to receive the
                NBA Rookie of the Year Award.[8] With final averages of 20.9 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 5.9 assists per
                game,[44] he also became the third player in league history to average at least 20 points, 5 rebounds,
                and 5 assists per game as a rookie.[45] Cleveland ultimately finished the season 35–47, failing to make
                the playoffs despite an 18-game improvement over the previous year.</p>
